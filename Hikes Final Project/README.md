# Hikes

## Synopsis
*The purpose of this program is to provide a hike to a user who is looking with some specifics they can choose from when promted.*

## Motivation
*The reason why I picked hikes to use in my program is because I am a fan of the outdoors and having somthing that makes my selection easier is sometimes needed. I knew I would enjoy making a program that I like.*

##  How to run
*To run this project you need to answer the prompts and input the data it requires. After you input the data it will choose from a selection of hikes, and distribute them to the user.*

## Code example
```
for(int i = 0; i < hikes.length; i++){
                if (diff[difficulty-1].equals(hikes[i][2])){
                    if (pref[preference-1].equals(hikes[i][5])){
                            System.out.println(hikes[i][0] + " " + "hike details include: " + hikes[i][1] + " miles, " + hikes[i][3] + ", " + hikes[i][4]);
```

*I was pretty proud of this code, I like how simple it made the code and it looks like I put in alot of effort but it was effortless.* 

*I believe this could be useful for other things you are wanting to shorten a list for. It could be used for the basics of finding a place to eat and having more requirements for food. You could even do it to choose a tv show or a movie based on genre maybe even actors. It would be alot of data input but thats this kind of job.*
